## Developers Notes

1. To help make the next few API endpoints easy to type, save your token to the console.

    ```bash
    NWAPP_API_TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN'
    ```

2. You will notice ``http`` used in the sample calls through this document, this is the ``Python`` command line application called ``HTTPie``. Download the command line application by following [these instructions](https://httpie.org/).


3. If you are going to make any contributions, please make sure your edits follow the [API documentation standard](https://gist.github.com/iros/3426278) for this document; in addition, please read [Googles API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/) for further consideration.
